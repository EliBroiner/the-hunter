# B — Flutter Build

When the user writes **"B"** (alone):
- Run **`flutter build apk`** from the project root. Do not commit or push.

---

# P — Commit & Push

When the user writes **"P"** (alone):
- Run **`git add -A`**, then **`git commit -m "<descriptive message>"`** (summarize recent changes if obvious), then **`git push`**.
- Do not run a build. Do not ask for confirmation.

# B P — Build APK then Commit & Push

When the user writes **"B P"** (or "B AND P", "B and P", "B&P") or **"בניה"** (Hebrew):

1. **Build APK:** Run `flutter build apk` (from project root).
2. **If build succeeds (exit 0):** Run:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"` (summarize recent changes if obvious)
   - `git push`
3. **If build fails:** Do not commit or push; report the error.

Do not ask for confirmation between build and commit/push when the user explicitly requested "B P" (or בניה).
