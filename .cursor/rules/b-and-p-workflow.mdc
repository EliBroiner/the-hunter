# B AND P — Build APK then Commit & Push

When the user writes **"B AND P"** (or "B and P", "B&P") or **"בניה"** (Hebrew):

1. **Build APK:** Run `flutter build apk` (from project root).
2. **If build succeeds (exit 0):** Run:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<descriptive message>"` (summarize recent changes if obvious)
   - `git push`
3. **If build fails:** Do not commit or push; report the error.

Do not ask for confirmation between build and commit/push when the user explicitly requested "B AND P".
